## Using This Guide

This is the *official* guide to Chai-UI. 
The best way to get started is to read [the
 Getting Started guide](guide/getting_started.md).
For detailed references on every function,
 class, enum, and struct, check out the 
 files in the `reference` folder. Each 
 subfolder contains a `locator.md` to help 
 you find what you need quickly.
